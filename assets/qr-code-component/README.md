## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a little more about positioning with Flexbox and "position".

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}
```
```css
.attribution {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
}
```
### Continued development

I plan to focus more on 'Grid Layou't so I can create several different types of layouts, I also plan to learn 'Sass' to make 'CSS' rules easier and improve the design of my future projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - On this platform, I like to explore the tutorials and guides to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I like to practice the examples and also use the documentation to better understand frontend web development.
  
- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I study interactive tutorials and practical examples on web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I learn with detailed exercises and references, on this platform I also improve my web development skills.
